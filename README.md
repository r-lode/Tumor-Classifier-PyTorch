## Project Description

The goal of this project is to use the PyTorch library to build a convolutional neural network to classify tumors given image data. Tumors are divided into four classes: no tumor, glioma tumor, meningioma_tumor, and pituitary tumor.

Data Source: [Brain Tumor Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamgrover/brain-tumor-classification).

Below is a sample of tumor images and their respective labels:
